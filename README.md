# File Management System Project

Hello and welcome! This document contains insight into my process of designing and building a simple File Manager! 

## What is a File Management System?

A file management system is a system or program that allows a user to manipulate files. Some very common examples include File Explorer on Windows, and Finder on macOS. These applications empower the user with a plethora of options to manage and organise files, both of which utilise a clean and intuitive user interface which facilitates ease of use and functionality. 

To list some functions included in a File Management System

- **Creating**: Create new folders/ files.
- **Moving**: Change the location of existing folders/ files.
- **Renaming**: Change the name of folders/ files.
- **Deleting**: Deleting folders/ files.

These are perhaps the most common and useful actions a FMS can perform.


## The Why?

You are very likely wondering, "with the options of File Explorer and Finder, why would anyone ever want to create their own FMS?", well, there are some valuable lessons one can learn from building their own system, with the ability to impliment any desired functionality, a custom built FMS allows tailor made functions that even File Explorer/ Finder cannot perform, with the extent of customisation left in the hands of the person creating the system, and their specific needs. 

Some Benfits Include:
